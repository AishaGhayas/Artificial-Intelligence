symbolic AI limitations: image tagging, language translation
(ML, DL both learns from data)
ML learns from data not from rules
DL advanced ML field in which NN are used.
auto feature engineering in DL
----------------------------------------------------------------
Alan turing introduced turing test in which a system is questioned by human and if the human fails to access that whether the machine is replying or the human then the system passes the test

ML algorithms:
1. probabilistic model:
    stats model which incorporates stats algorithm naive bayes used for classification
2. kernel method:
    e.g SVM support vector machine (in SVM we have to do transformation ourselves)
    it incorporates group of classification algorithms. hyperplane is a line that seperates data into classes
3. decision trees(/CART classification and regression tree)
    makes hierarchy by lining input and output. what input gives what output
4. random forest
    large number of decision trees are linked together to predict and vote from majority decision tree is the final label of output
5. boosting machine learning
    e.g: Ada boost, gradient boost
    donot repeat previous mistakes. weak learner --> strong learner
    
----------------------------------------------------------------   
parameters are w & b
hyperparameter gives values e.g: input layer= output layer= activationfunc= loss func=
structure created is hypothesis space 
more layers more deep the network is
deep learning could be named as layered representations learning / hierarchical representations learning
----------------------------------------------------------------
first time weights applied its forward propagation
after loss feedback weights updated and applied is back propagation
----------------------------------------------------------------
datasets: LeNet, imageNet
